# Random_Password_Generator

## The Respository

This application can be used by an employee to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected. This application also adapts to multiple screen sizes so the employee can render passwords on-the-go.

## Instructions

When the generate a password button is clicked, a series of prompts containing criteria are displayed.

- This includes:
   - the length of password
   - uppercase characters `ABCEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ`
   - lowercase characters `abcedfghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`
   - numeric characters `0123456789`
   - special characters `@%+ \\/""!#'$^?:,)(}{][~-_.`

The selected criteria is then written in the display box which can be copied and pasted for use by the employee. Limitations of the generator are:

- One character type must be selected 

- The length can not be below 10 or over 64 characters.
